PREDICTING_GENRE_FROM_MOVIE_POSTERS
Posters represent one way in which people use media to
influence human behavior. One industry that is reliant upon
the efficacy of posters is the film industry. It is advantageous
for movies to have good posters, since they increase interest
in watching the movie. Good posters are posters able to
communicate important aspects of a film such as cast, theme,
and elements of plot. Thus, designers have incentive to
include salient features in their posters to make their movie
attract more viewers. The topic of image recognition with
respect to movie posters is interesting for a few reasons.
First, it would have practical implications for advertisers
of movies. Movies are commonly marketed using posters,
which means that a model that could identify features that
predispose them to success would be beneficial. Second, it
would be an interesting experiment into what aspects of
posters individuals find appealing and is useful for media
creators generally. Finally, the topic of image recognition
allows us to take explore a wide variety of algorithms and
network architectures to create a successful model.
